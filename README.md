# Statistics-Helper-Library
this library contains some lightweight math functions for my projects.

The focus is on simplicity, stability and the utmost performance I'm personally able to archieve with my skills.

It is not about errorhandling. 
While I try to add unit tests to my projects, do a quick test yourself and check if the data pushed out by this library actually makes sense to you.

# Current implementations
### average
- Moving average
- Quick average on the fly (omitting memory restraints and overflow)
- Volumetric average for 2 values (averaging two values by teir weight)
