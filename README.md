# Statistics-Helper-Library
this library contains some lightweight math functions for my projects.

The focus is on simplicity, stability and the utmost performance I'm personally able to archieve with my skills.

It is not about total stability or errorhandling. 
While I try to add unit tests to my projects, do a quick test yourself and check if the data pushed out by this library actually makes sense to you.
